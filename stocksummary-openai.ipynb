       "### Analyzing Stock Data\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Understanding Key Terms**:\n",
       "    - **Open Price**: The price of the stock at the start of the trading week.\n",
       "    - **Close Price**: The price at the end of the trading week.\n",
       "    - **High**: The maximum price during the week.\n",
       "    - **Low**: The minimum price during the week.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Identifying Trends**:\n",
       "   - **Price Movement**: Look at the 'Open' and 'Close' prices over the weeks. If the close price is consistently higher than the open price, it indicates a bullish trend (the stock is gaining).\n",
       "   - **Volatility**: Check the differences between high and low prices. Large fluctuations might suggest high volatility, meaning the stock price is changing significantly week to week.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Overall Sentiment**:\n",
       "   - If there are more weeks with increasing close prices overall compared to those with decreasing close prices, it shows positive sentiment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Calculating Total Returns\n",
       "\n",
       "To calculate the total returns over the period:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Formula**:\n",
       "   \\[\n",
       "   \\text{Total Return (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Final Close Price} - \\text{Initial Open Price}}{\\text{Initial Open Price}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
       "   \\]\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Example Calculation**:\n",
       "   - Suppose the **Initial Open Price** (first week) is $1000 and the **Final Close Price** (last week) is $1200.\n",
       "   \\[\n",
       "   \\text{Total Return (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{1200 - 1000}{1000} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n",
       "   \\]\n",
       "\n",
       "### Suggestions for Your Analysis\n",
       "- Look for patterns in the weekly close prices to determine whether the stock has been on an upward or downward trajectory.\n",

       "   - The **close price** is how much the stock was worth at the end of that week.\n",

       "\n",
       "2. **Highs and Lows**:\n",
       "   - The **high** indicates the highest price of the stock for that week, while the **low** indicates the lowest price.\n",
       "   - An increasing high may suggest that the stock is gaining momentum.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Weekly Trends**:\n",
       "   - Look for patterns over the weeks. Are the closing prices generally moving higher? Is there a consistent pattern of rising or falling prices?\n",

       "### Calculating Total Returns\n",
       "\n",
       "To calculate the total returns in percentage:\n",
       "1. **Find the Initial and Final Prices**:\n",
       "   - Identify the closing price from the first week (initial price) and the closing price from the last week (final price).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Use the Total Returns Formula**:\n",
       "   \\[\n",
       "   \\text{Total Returns \\%} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Final Price} - \\text{Initial Price}}{\\text{Initial Price}}\\right) \\times 100\n",
       "   \\]\n",
       "This formula helps quantify the gain or loss over the entire period as a percentage of the initial investment.\n",

       "### Example Calculation (Hypothetical)\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Initial Price** (1st week close): $500\n",
       "- **Final Price** (last week close): $600\n",
       "\n",
       "Using the formula:\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Total Returns \\%} = \\left(\\frac{600 - 500}{500}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{100}{500}\\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n",

       "### Summary\n",
       "To analyze the stock TSLA, you would focus on its opening and closing prices to identify trends, as well as highs and lows for market fluctuations. Once you have the necessary data, you can calculate the total returns over the specified period.\n",
